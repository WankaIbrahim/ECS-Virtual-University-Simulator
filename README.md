ECS Virtual University Simulator
This coursework involves the creation of a simplified virtual university simulation called "EcsSim". The simulation includes various university elements such as halls, labs, theatres, and staff, each contributing to the university's growth. The primary goal of EcsSim is to build facilities and hire staff using a simulated currency, "EcsCoins", to create a successful university. The university's reputation and EcsCoins are earned by teaching students. The coursework is designed to assess your Java programming skills and your ability to implement specific constructs as per the provided specification. The development process is sequenced to gradually increase the functionality and complexity of your university. It's important to note that while EcsSim may bear some similarities to a real university, it is a simplified version and may differ in some aspects.
